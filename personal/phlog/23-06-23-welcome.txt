Welcome to my blog!

Hello, I have decided to set up a blog on my website :) 
Basically, I will use this page to create more long-form posts to express various ideas and other things that 
I've found cool recently. 

How does the website work? 
--------------------------
The frontend was all written by me in raw HTML/CSS. 
The little time marquee at the top of the page was my own idea, 
but I "borrowed" the time formatting code from Stack Overflow. 
In terms of backend, the website uses Jekyll and is being hosted on GitHub using Vercel to deploy it. 
If anything is not working or you just want to contact me, contact me on Discord @mounderfod.
